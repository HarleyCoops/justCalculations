\section*{Overview}
justCalculations is a supplemental tool designed to help CFA and FRM candidates master the calculations required for their exams. It provides step-by-step breakdowns of complex calculations, detailed keystroke guides for approved calculators, and practice questions designed to enhance problem-solving skills under time pressure.

\section*{Problem}
The financial community's approach to financial education often leaves a gap in exam preparation for CFA and FRM candidates. Practice questions can feel significantly more complex on exam day than anticipated, leading to unexpected challenges and decreased confidence during re-attempts.

\section*{Solution}
justCalculations addresses this gap by focusing on:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Calculation Building Blocks}: Breaking down complex calculations into manageable steps.
    \item \textbf{Calculator Proficiency}: Providing detailed keystroke guides for both approved calculators.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Benefits}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Increased Confidence}: Mastering calculation building blocks and calculator techniques boosts confidence.
    \item \textbf{Improved Speed}: Efficient calculator use and a focus on time-pressured problem-solving improve speed.
    \item \textbf{Better Training}: justCalculations complements existing study materials with a practical, hands-on approach.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Target Audience}
CFA and FRM exam candidates seeking to improve their calculation skills and overall exam performance.

\section*{Key Features}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Step-by-step calculation breakdowns
    \item Detailed calculator keystroke guides
    \item Focus on time-pressured problem-solving
    \item Designed as a supplemental tool for exam preparation
